# Script Name: 3_QAQC_Interpolate__Smooth.R
# Function: This script reads in the .CSV files created from "1_Hypack Data 
#           Parser_****.R', "2_ASDL Data Processing.R' and"2b_Manual Beacon 
#           Position Calculator.R". It fills in the best position and depth data 
#           source for each dive, and interpolates Lat/Longs for Ship GPS 
#           position and vehicle beacon. Next, distance to GPS track is 
#           calculated for each beacon point, and points outside of median+2.5 *
#           IQRare identified as outliers, and beacon fixes at these time points 
#           are removed. Beacon positions are interpolated a second time (with 
#           outliers removed). Beacon positions are then smoothed using a 
#           rolling median (overlapping medians), using stats::runmed(). 
#           Bandwidth is set in the 'STEP 1' portion of these scripts. 
#           Final data for each dive are written to .CSV.

# May 13, 2020: Based on conversations with J.Nephin and S. Jeffery, decided to 
#               add linear interpolation of the depth data stream. Depth record 
#               completion now checks ASDL to see if additional data records can 
#               be found.
# May 24, 2020: Added a check to see if there were additional records that could 
#               be recovered from ASDL for Altitude and Slant Range. FOR 2019 
#               ONLY, added loop to pull Bottom_Velocity_Y (forward velocity). 
#               For some dives in 2019, the 3D dimensional velocity had been 
#               recorded by Hypack, rather then simply forward velocity. Added 
#               linear interpolation of Slant Range and Altitude, but only for 
#               cases where there is just one NA value in a row. This is done by 
#               setting zoo::na.approx(..., maxgap = 1).
# June 3, 2020: Reworked the initial loop that checks ASDL to replace NA values 
#               from the Hypack read-in. This was previously only working 
#               properly for the positional data streams (it checked that GAPS 
#               == T for all data, not just position)
# June 3, 2020: In some cases, interpolation of a -9999 and a normal Altitude or
#               Slant Range values produced values in the range of -4000 or 
#               -5000. These is now a check against this, and values are reset 
#               to -9999 after interpolation.
# July 2, 2020: Removed the portion of this script that was previously used to 
#               generate .KML and .SHP files, and put it in a new script called
#               "4b_Generate_KML_and_Shapefiles.R"
# Aug 20, 2021: Added if() statement to check if the manual beacon tracking 
#               script has been run, before trying to interpolate from this data 
#               source. If this script has not been run, skip this portion.
# Jan 2022: - Wrote function for filling gaps
#           - Applied function to each ASDL source used for filling gaps
#           - Returns number of gaps detected and filled each time
#           - Fixed speed unit error, used to replace knots with m/s
#           - Check the relationship between variables in tofill and forfilling
#             before filling gaps
#           - Question: what to do when relationship is bad, don't fill?
#             eg. speed_kts
#           - attempted to make code more explicit, removed use of column order
#           - rewrote offset section to fix issue with if statements, need to
#             confirm it is working as intended
#           - Using distGeo instead of distm function for step 7
#           - Only removing upper qauntile outliers (not lower)
#           - added log file
#           - saves transect maps to file comparing rov and ship positions
#           - exports all transects and each transect NAV files to csv
#           - removed ship_name as it wasn't used
#           - added original script 4 to this script to reduce # of steps
#           - uses RBR CTD data from excel files first, then ASDL backup second
#           - longlat rounded to 6th decimal place
#           - renamed some attributes
#           - doesn't use ship pos to fill gaps in beacon
#           - check ships pos for outliers (greater than 25m between pos)
#           - outlier cutoff too sensitive, changed to 2.5 IQR
# Oct 2022: - Move offset part to step 4, and only used if offsets were not applied
#             or applied incorrectly in hypack
